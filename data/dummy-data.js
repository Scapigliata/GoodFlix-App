    'The film paints a dark image of reality in Gotham. Throughouot the film there are countless cases of doubling. From the recurance of clowns in cars to Arthur Flecks iterations of banging his head into panes of glass, repetition is something that not only characterizes madness but also continues to permeate throughout the film. Reality seemingly unravels, and as the film progresses his sanity deteriorates, as mirrored in the surrounding.',
